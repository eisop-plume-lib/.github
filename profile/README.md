This organization contains forks of the corresponding [plume-lib](https://github.com/plume-lib) projects.

This is to isolate the CI tests of the [EISOP Checker Framework](https://github.com/eisop/checker-framework) from changes in plume-lib.

The projects in this organization are not released and are generally not intended to be used,
except for [plume-scripts](https://github.com/eisop-plume-lib/plume-scripts) and [git-scripts](https://github.com/eisop-plume-lib/git-scripts),
which are used in the EISOP CF build.
